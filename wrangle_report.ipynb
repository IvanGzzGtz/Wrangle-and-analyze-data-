I wanted to do the API way because I know how important and useful it is. Ill Probably do a course regarding the APIs in the future. I hope udacity offer one about it. \n",

I looked everywhere on the internet and on stackflow but didnt find the answer I needed, so I went to the knowledge base here on udacity and it turns out there was a user that had the same question. I read the question and then the answered. Everything was clearer to me.\n",

It took me a lot of time and research to identify the quality issues and the tidiness issues, but after a while you start notice errors on the dataframe such as non values, datatypes, wrong names etc. This was the longest and hardest part for me. Knowing how to look for those errors is a key value to data wrangling. Its the hardest but simplest part of all (for me). I realized that after detecting the issues on the data frame, they were so obvious, that I felt bad not seeing them since day one.  I looked for information to get this part done in https://www.ringlead.com/blog/the-7-most-common-types-of-dirty-data-and-how-to-clean-them/ It helped a little bit but I continued doing some research both on the internet and the knowledge base. I hope and think I found the correct  errors. Well, at least some part of them. Maybe there are more. \n",
